Iesi.Collections
================

Additional `ISet<T>` implementations for .Net 4.

This library was based on http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/3190/Add-Support-for-quot-Set-quot-Collections-to-NET,
but the version for .NET 4 is significantly different, since `ISet<T>` is now available in the framework itself.
