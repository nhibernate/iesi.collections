These are the tasks typically needed to create an official Iesi.Collections release.


  * In Jira, make sure no open issues have "fix version" set to the release
    that is about to happen (as these will show in the release notes).
  
  * Update releasenotes.txt with list of issues from Jira's Release Notes
    feature. See if any additions to the list of "known breaking changes"
    are necessary.
	
  * Check/update version number in default.build.
  
  * Don't forget to commit the above.
  
  * Perform the release build including running all tests (GaRelease.bat).
	
	NOTE: If you prefer to keep your source code in a path like e.g.:
	  C:\Users\Something\Long\Projects\iesi.collections
	you may want to issue a command like:
	  subst P: C:\Users\Something\Long\Projects
	And then change to P:\iesi.collections before building. This will avoid
	displaying a long user-specific path in public symbol files.
	
  * If no error or other issue requiring further changes occured, tag the
    current git HEAD with a tag according to version number. Don't forget to
	push the tag to github. Tag format normally: x.y.z.s where s is e.g. CR1,
    GA, etc.
	
  * Upload binary and source zip files to SourceForge. Update the "latest
    release". (http://sourceforge.net/projects/nhibernate/files/Iesi.Collections/)

  * Update download link on NHForge.
  
  * Push nuget packages including the symbol packages.
  
  * In Jira, mark the version as released.
  
  * Post release announcement to nhusers, nhibernate-development and as
    project news on SourceForge.
	
	
  * If this was a stable branch, merge it forward to main. Perhaps some
    changes need to be edited out in the merge, but this will reduce the
	risk of some issue being left unfixed on main.


  * Several weeks or months after the release, in Jira, we will assume all
    issues resolved in the release have been verified. Go ahead and close
    them.
